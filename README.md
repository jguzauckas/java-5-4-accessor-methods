# AP Computer Science A - Unit 5 Section 4

# Accessor Methods

This section pauses our work on classes to introduce documentation in code with comments. This is a skill that will benefit the readability of your code moving forward, becoming much more important with creating classes.

This section covers the following material:

- Method Information
- Accessor Methods
- `return` by Value
- `toString` Methods

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
